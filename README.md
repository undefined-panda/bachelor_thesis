# bachelor_thesis
Program of my bachelor thesis 2024.

The objective is to improved pulsar detection by creating customized filters for CNNs. With enhanced filter initialization, the CNNs are expected to converge faster and achieve greater accuracy.

Part of my thesis was to create my own synthesized dataset. The code can be found in ```synthetic_data_generation.py```. An exponential decaying function is employed to simulate the shape of a pulsar image, replicating its dispersion delay frequency measurement.

To execute the tests run ```main.py```.
